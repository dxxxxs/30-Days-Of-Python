# 🐍 30 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python** journey! This repository contains my solutions and learnings from the [30 Days of Python Challenge](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) created by [Asabeneh Yetayeh](https://github.com/Asabeneh). 🚀

## 📚 About the Challenge

The **30 Days of Python Challenge** is an excellent opportunity to deepen your Python programming knowledge through practical exercises and projects. Each day, we tackle new concepts and solve problems that build upon the previous lessons.

## 🛠️ Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
📂 30-Days-of-Python/
├── 📁 Day_1
│   ├── exercises_1.md
│   ├── exercises_2.py
│   ├── exercises_3.py
│   └── notes.md (optional)
├── 📁 Day_2
│   ├── exercises.py
│   └── notes.md (optional)
├── ...
└── 📁 Day_30
    ├── exercises.py
    └── notes.md (optional)
```

- Each folder represents a day in the challenge.
- **`exercises.py`** contains my solutions to the exercises of that day.
- **`notes.md`** includes my notes, summaries, and observations.
